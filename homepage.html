        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>Perspective Design was founded by Peter Bain and George Slomp in 2016. Both of them had been working independently as contractors and were ready to start some thing new, something bigger. Merging their two companies, they each both brought to the business their own expertise, experience, clients, contacts, and contractors, which makes the company richer, deeper, and more solid. George and Peter have built the Perspective Team upon a foundation of working in this field, in the Valley for almost 10 years each. Perspective Design Build is about good quality people who do good quality work.</p>
